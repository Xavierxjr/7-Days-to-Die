Experimental work in progress.



Launch

Place the bathtub boat on/in water in a 'shallow water' area that has fairly flat ground underneath, if you have no shallow water in your map then build a small launch dock, then add fuel to bath tub boat and off you go. 

The Bath tub boat will behave irratically if placed on land and will damage player made blocks.


Controls

Usual controls for 'vehicles' except space bar and c control the up and down angles (same as the gyro) which you may need to adjust slightly as you travel on water.  
If you let go of w and shift (Turbo) then the boat slowly comes to a stop, pressing s will slow the boat down more quickly this replaces spacebar as the brake key.
To anchor the bath boat and stop it drifting away use c and spacebar to level the boat till it stops drifting, useful if you have a fishing mod installed.

The bath tub boat can be picked up into inventory, if you sink it at any point, although be careful if you sink it too far away from the shores as it could be a long swim back. Best to not store stuff as Zombies now can attack water vehicles in game.

The bathtub boat is craftable in a standard workbench with no progression needed at the cost of resources by creating the required assemblies to build it,  it will help early game if you actually find a 'working workbench' and allow you to make the bath tub a lot sooner.


Along the way 'water vehicle options' in the game will expand, there are some bigger boats and new smaller options in the works.

As of the 9th September 2020 I have a small fishing boat (WIP) and a Larger River boat (WIP).

Next planned watercraft are the smaller types 1 seater and 2 seater and looking at a yacht.


There are a few known issues (not show stopping) that need work arounds but trying hard to not go the code route , so hopefully these can be worked out along the way.


Happy Boating in A19

Ragsy!!
